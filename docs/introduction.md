# Welcome

Think of this space as your personal scrap book. Use it to take notes, jot down model or api ideas, and generally work on things that don't fit into a single obvious "project".

There are a number of example files in this project to help you get started. We have organized them in what we think is a reasonable layout, but feel free to arrange your projects however you like!

### Directories

- **reference**: This directory includes a couple of example APIs described in the OpenAPI v2 (Swagger) and OpenAPI v3 formats.
- **docs**: Keep articles and relevant assets in this folder. Included to start are a couple of articles that describe how to write Markdown, and some of the advanced Markdown features unique to Stoplight Studio.
- **models**: If you find yourself defining the same model multiple times, it might be a good idea to break it out to a standalone file. You can then reference and re-use this file which reduces the amount of duplication in your project, and increases the maintainability. `models` directories include a number of common models that are referenced by the apis defined in the `apis` directory.
